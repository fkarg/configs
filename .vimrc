" Description: A minimal, but feature rich, example .vimrc. If you are a
"             newbie, basing your first .vimrc on this file is a good
" choice.
"             If you're a more advanced user, building your own .vimrc
" based
"             on this file is still a good idea.
"
"------------------------------------------------------------
" Features
"
" These options and commands enable some very useful features in Vim, that
" no user should have to live without.
"
" Set 'nocompatible' to ward off unexpected things that your distro might
" have made, as well as sanely reset options when re-sourcing .vimrc
set nocompatible

" Attempt to determine the type of a file based on its name and possibly
"its
"" contents. Use this to allow intelligent auto-indenting for each filetype,
"" and for plugins that are filetype specific.
"filetype indent plugin on
"
" " Enable syntax highlighting
syntax on


"------------------------------------------------------------
" Must have options
"
" These are highly recommended options.
"
"" Vim with default settings does not allow easy switching between
"multiple files
"" in the same editor window. Users can use multiple split windows or
"multiple
"" tab pages to edit multiple files, but it is still best to enable an
"option to
"" allow easier switching between files.
""
"" One such option is the 'hidden' option, which allows you to re-use
"the same
"" window and switch from an unsaved buffer without saving it first.
"Also allows
"" you to keep an undo history for multiple files when re-using the
"same window
"" in this way. Note that using persistent undo also lets you undo in
"multiple
"" files even in the same window, but is less efficient and is
"actually designed
"" for keeping undo history after closing Vim entirely. Vim will
"complain if you
"" try to quit without saving, and swap files will keep you safe if
"your computer
"" crashes.
"set hidden

"" Note that not everyone likes working this way (with the hidden
"option).
"" Alternatives include using tabs or split windows instead of
"re-using the same
" window as mentioned above, and/or either of the following options:
" set confirm
" set autowriteall

"" Better command-line completion
set wildmenu
" set wildmode=list:longest
set wildignore=*.swp,*.bak,*.pyc,*.class,.*,*.hi,*.o
"
" Show partial commands in the last line of the screen
set showcmd

"" Highlight searches (use <C-L> to temporarily turn off
"highlighting; see the
"" mapping of <C-L> below)
set hlsearch
"
" " Modelines have historically been a source of security
" vulnerabilities. As
" " such, it may be a good idea to disable them and use the
" securemodelines
" " script,
" <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1876>.
" " set nomodeline

""------------------------------------------------------------
"" Usability options
""
"" These are options that users frequently set in their .vimrc.
"Some of them
"" change Vim's behaviour in ways which deviate from the true
"Vi way, but
"" which are considered to add usability. Which, if any, of
"these options to
"" use is very much a personal preference, but they are
"harmless.

"" Use case insensitive search, except when using capital
"letters
set ignorecase
"set smartcase

" " Allow backspacing over autoindent, line breaks and start
" of insert action
set backspace=indent,eol,start

"" When opening a new line and no filetype-specific
"indenting is enabled, keep
"" the same indent as the line you're currently on. Useful
"for READMEs, etc.
"set autoindent

"" Stop certain movements from always going to the first
"character of a line.
"" While this behaviour deviates from that of Vi, it does
"what most users
"" coming from other editors would expect.
"set nostartofline

"" Display the cursor position on the last line of the
"screen or in the status
"" line of a window
set ruler

" " Always display the status line, even if only one
" window is displayed
set laststatus=2
"
"" Instead of failing a command because of unsaved
"changes, instead raise a
"" dialogue asking if you wish to save changed files.
set confirm
"
" Use visual bell instead of beeping when doing
"something wrong
set visualbell

"" And reset the terminal code for the visual bell. If
"visualbell is set, and
"" this line is also included, vim will neither flash
"nor beep. If visualbell
"" is unset, this does nothing.
"set t_vb=

"" Enable use of the mouse for all modes
"set mouse=a
"
"" Set the command window height to 2 lines, to
"avoid many cases of having to
""press <Enter> to continue"
set cmdheight=2
"
" Display line numbers on the left
set number
"
"" Quickly time out on keycodes, but never time
"out on mappings
"set notimeout ttimeout ttimeoutlen=200

"" Use <F11> to toggle between 'paste' and
"'nopaste'
" set pastetoggle=<F7>

""------------------------------------------------------------
"" Indentation options
""
"" Indentation settings according to personal
"preference.
"
" " Indentation settings for using 4 spaces
" instead of tabs.
" " Do not change 'tabstop' from its default
" value of 8 with this setup.
" set shiftwidth=4
" set softtabstop=4
" set expandtab

" Indentation settings for using hard tabs
"for indent. Display tabs as
" four characters wide.
"set shiftwidth=4
"set tabstop=4
"
"

"------------------------------------------------------------
" Mappings
"
" Useful mappings
"
"" Map Y to act like D and C, i.e. to yank
"until EOL, rather than act as yy,
"" which is the default
"map Y y$
"
" " Map <C-L> (redraw screen) to also turn
" off search highlighting until the
" " next search
nnoremap <C-L> :nohl<CR><C-L>


" For multi line version you can do this after selecting the text:
"
" :'<,'>:w !command<CR>
" You can map it to simple visual mode shortcut like this:
"

xnoremap <leader>c <esc>:'<,'>:w !fish<CR>
" Hit leader key + c in visual mode to send the selected text to a stdin of the command. stdout of the command will be printed below vim's statusbar.

"  "------------------------------------------------------------
"
" Helping for c-files and the like:
"  :make
"
"  :cn  = next error (even other file)
"  :cc  = current error message
"
" $ ctags *.c
"  -> creates tags for all *.c files.
"  vi -t function jumps to function
"  CTRL-] jumps to function definition
"  CTRL-T jumps back one level

" Turn Vim into a Distraction-Free Word Processor
" While Vim is a great text editor for developers, it‚Äôs also great for those
" who want a simplified, customizable yet distraction-free environment for
" writing.
"
" With a few lines of code, you can configure vim to switch into a ‚Äúword
" processor‚Äù mode when required. This changes how text is formatted in the
" editor, and introduces things like spellchecking.
"
" First, create a function called WordProcessorMode, and include the following
" lines of code.
"
" vim-wordprocessormode
"
" func! WordProcessorMode()
"  setlocal textwidth=80
"  setlocal smartindent
"  setlocal spell spelllang=en_us
"  setlocal noexpandtab
" endfu
" Then, you‚Äôre going to need to define how you‚Äôll activate it. The
" following line of code allows you to create a command. When in command
" mode, if you call ‚ÄúWP‚Äù, it will activate word processor mode.
"
" vim-callwordprocessormode
"
" com! WP call WordProcessorMode()
" To test that it works, open a new text file in VIM, and press escape.
" Then type ‚ÄúWP‚Äù, and hit enter. Then, type some text, with some words
" intentionally spelled incorrectly. If VIM highlights them as incorrect,
" then you know you've installed it correctly.
